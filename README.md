## CUDA Experiments  

### Day 1: 1D Array Copy (`1Dcopy.cu`)  

**Summary:**  
Implemented a CUDA kernel for copying a 1D array.  

**Learned:**  
- Indexing threads using a 1D hierarchy.  
- Allocating memory on the GPU (`cudaMalloc`).  
- Transferring memory between CPU and GPU (`cudaMemcpy`).  

### Day 2: 1D Array Addition (`add.cu`)  

**Summary:**  
Implemented a CUDA kernel for addying 2 1D Arrays.  

**Learned:**  
- Same concepts with an extra input in form of an array.
